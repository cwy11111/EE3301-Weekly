# A graph with  𝑛 vertices and  𝑛  edges can be a bipartite graph as well as a tree graph.  

Bipartite graph:

A graph is a bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles.

Tree graph:

An undirected graph is a tree if it is connected and does not contaion a cycle.

First: every tree graph is a bipartite graph

Second, the relation between vertices(V) and edges(E) in a tree graph is E = V - 1. So it is impossible for a tree graph to have the same number of vertices and edges.

So the statement "A graph with  𝑛 vertices and  𝑛  edges can be a bipartite graph as well as a tree graph." is false unless the statement turn into "A graph with n vertices and n-1 edges.
